# Gear

Gear is QuadCam's second half: the FPV bench next to the clip library. This page covers what
works today. The full plan is in [Gear design](gear-design.md).

## What QuadCam finds

QuadCam looks for gear every 2 seconds while the app runs. It never opens a port or writes to a
device to do so.

| Device | How QuadCam finds it |
|---|---|
| EdgeTX radio | Its SD card in USB Storage mode. QuadCam reads `board` and `semver` from `RADIO/radio.yml` |
| Goggles card | A card with DJI clips |
| DVR card | A card with analog clips |
| Flight controller | A USB serial port with an STM32 or AT32 virtual COM port id |
| ELRS module | A USB serial port with a CP210x, CH340 or CH9102 id |
| Radio in DFU mode | The STM32 bootloader (`0483:df11`) |

When nothing shows, QuadCam says: "Nothing found. If macOS asked to allow an accessory, click
Allow." macOS keeps a new USB accessory off until you allow it, and QuadCam cannot see that
question.

A card in the built-in SD slot gets its id from a hash of the card's own serial number, so a
format keeps it. Other cards and radios get theirs from a hash of the volume UUID. A flight
controller gets its id when QuadCam identifies it.

## Saved devices

QuadCam keeps the devices you name in `gear.json`, in the gear folder:

```
~/Library/Application Support/app.quadcam/gear/gear.json
```

The `gear_dir` setting moves the gear folder. `gear.json` follows the same rules as the settings
file: every writer changes only what it was asked to change, keeps every other key, and the
running app sees a change from the command line or an agent within 2 seconds.

An aircraft profile can name its gear (`gear`: `fc`, `radio`, `edgetx_model`, `rx`,
`pack_type`). Profiles without it load and save as before.

## Unplugging cards

QuadCam tracks four device events: connected, identified, unmounted but still inserted, and
removed.

A card in a USB card reader is "still inserted" only after `diskutil unmountDisk`: the disk
stays listed until you pull the card. After `diskutil eject` the disk goes at once, so QuadCam
cannot tell an ejected card from a pulled one. The built-in SD slot reports the card until you
pull it. A DJI air unit stays on USB after its volume unmounts.

## Cues

QuadCam can speak, play a sound, and post a notification. It does so once, when a job ends,
never for its own mounts and unmounts along the way:

| Cue | When |
|---|---|
| Done, safe to unplug | A job on a device finished. A run over several devices says it once |
| Still inserted | A card is still in after "done": after 60 seconds, then every 5 minutes, 3 times at most |
| Step failed | A step of a job failed |

The `gear_cues` setting holds:

- `mute`, and a toggle for each cue (`safe_to_unplug`, `still_inserted`, `step_failed`) and
  each channel (`speech`, `sound`, `notification`). Speech and notifications are on by
  default; sound is off.
- `debounce_s` (30): the same cue for the same device plays once in this time.
- `reminder_grace_s` (60), `still_inserted_every_s` (300), `reminder_max` (3).
- `quiet_hours` (`{"start": "22:00", "end": "07:00"}`): no speech or sound in these hours.
  Notifications follow macOS Focus.
- `voice`: a `say` voice.

## Steps on connect

The `gear_on_connect` setting names the steps that run when a device of each kind is plugged in:
`backup`, `import` and `apply_ready`. Only `backup` is on by default, and only while
`gear_auto_backup` is on. QuadCam adds the steps themselves in later releases.

## OSD

QuadCam draws a Betaflight OSD layout from a `dump all` or `diff all` file, one screen per OSD
profile, and checks each screen.

- **Positions:** each element has one position, shared by every profile. A profile only turns
  the element on or off.
- **Grids:** the file's `vcd_video_system` picks the grid: NTSC 30 x 13, PAL 30 x 16, HD
  53 x 20. `AUTO` or no setting draws on NTSC. You can pick another grid, or any W x H.
- **Element sizes:** each element draws as sample text (`B4.20V`, `L2:99`, `T00:00`), with
  letters for the font's symbols. The craft name draws as the `craft_name` value. An element
  QuadCam does not know draws 5 wide and is listed. Widths are QuadCam's own estimates, so treat
  a near miss as a hint.
- **Horizon:** the level line is drawn. The check uses its full sweep: 4 columns either side
  and 10 rows down from its position.
- **Check:** two elements on the same cells in one profile, or cells off the grid. The
  crosshairs may sit on the horizon, and other elements may sit on the camera frame.
- **Several files:** QuadCam reads them in order and a later line wins. A dump followed by an
  apply file shows the layout after the apply.
- **A diff alone:** a diff leaves out every setting at its default. QuadCam shows what the diff
  lists and says so.

In a development build, open the OSD screen at `http://localhost:4719/?osd`. The Aircraft page
will show it for the aircraft's flight controller once device backups arrive.

## Command line and agents

```bash
quadcam-cli --json gear status                       # gear folder, Gear settings, what is plugged in
quadcam-cli --json gear devices                      # saved devices
quadcam-cli --json gear devices save <id> --name "Bench radio" --aircraft Whoop
quadcam-cli --json gear devices forget <id>          # its backups stay
quadcam-cli gear osd quad.dump_all.txt --text        # each OSD profile drawn, and the check
quadcam-cli --json gear osd quad.dump_all.txt apply.cli --grid PAL
```

Agents use the `quadcam_gear`, `quadcam_gear_edit` and `quadcam_gear_apply` tools. See
[MCP server](mcp.md#gear).

## Tests and real devices

A process started by cargo never reaches real gear:

| Variable | Without it, under cargo | `real` |
|---|---|---|
| `QUADCAM_SERIAL` | No serial ports, no presence checks | Real ports and `ioreg` |
| `QUADCAM_CUES` | Cues are recorded, not played | `say`, `afplay`, `osascript` |
